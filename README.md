# PS4_Cheater & ps4debug

PS4 Cheater is homebrew APP to find game cheat codes, and it is based on [ps4debug](https://github.com/jogolden/ps4debug).

Supported Firmware: 5.05, 6.72, 7.02, 7.55.

Notable features:
  - Console scanner which does the scanning on the ps4 console.
  - Firmware agnostic ps4debug payload
    - One payload for all firmware (5.05, 6.72, 7.02, 7.55)
  - Multi-threaded scanning
  - Auto-pause function

I will be regularly updating the release pages with new releases with Changelog: https://github.com/ctn123/PS4_Cheater/releases
Apologies, I'm not updating the source code anymore. Too much drama releasing source code, so binaries only at this point.
